    "\n",
    "Each morning, the newsvendor must decide how many copies $u \\in \\{1, 2,…,u^{♯}\\}$ of the day’s paper to order. The variable u is called control.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the day, the newsvendor will meet an unknown demand $w  \\in \\{1,2,...,w^{♯}\\}$ . The variable w is called uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The newsvendor faces an economic tradeoﬀ:\n",
    "\n",
    "- He pays the unitary purchasing cost c per copy, when he orders stock;\n",
    "\n",
    "- He sells a copy at price p;\n",
    "\n",
    "- if he remains with an unsold copy, it is worthless (perishable good).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the newsvendor’s costs are (where w is a possible value of the demand)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$j(u,w) = cu-p\\min\\{u,w\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The newsvendor’s payoﬀ is $−j(u,w)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we introduce a random variable W, where $W : Ω →\\{1, 2,…,w^{♯}\\}$. Here, $Ω$ is an underlying probability space, equipped with a probability $ℙ$. We suppose that the newsvendor knows the probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{W}$ of the demand $W$.\n",

    "Thus equipped, we consider the stochastic optimization problem of expected costs minimization:\n",
